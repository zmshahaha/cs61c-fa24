This circuit simply takes two inputs, multiplies them together, and then adds the result to the current state value. For this circuit, let the propagation delay of an adder block be 45ns and the propagation delay of a multiplication block be 60ns. The register has a CLK-to-Q delay of 10ns, setup time of 10ns, and hold time of 5ns. Assume that both inputs receive their data from registers (so the inputs arrive CLK-to-Q after the rising edge).

Question 1: What is the length of the critical path of this circuit in ns. The answer should be an integer without any units.
